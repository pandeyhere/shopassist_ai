ShopAssist AI
Project Background
In today's digital age, online shopping has become the go-to option for many consumers. However, the overwhelming number of choices and the lack of personalized assistance can make the shopping experience daunting. To address this, we have developed ShopAssist AI, a chatbot that combines the power of large language models and rule-based functions to ensure accurate and reliable information delivery.

Problem Statement
Given a dataset containing information about laptops (product names, specifications, descriptions, etc.), build a chatbot that parses the dataset and provides accurate laptop recommendations based on user requirements.

Create and activate a virtual environment:

```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

```

Install dependencies:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable:
```
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your_openai_api_key'  # On Windows, use `set OPENAI_API_KEY='your_openai_api_key'`
```

Run the Python App:

```
python3 chatbot.py

```
